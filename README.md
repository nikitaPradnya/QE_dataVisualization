# QE_dataVisualization

This is a limited project on data visualization of Quantum ESPRESSO simulation.

Initially, was created for my thesis but is planned to be developed for an automized data visualization scriptâ€”I know how annoying it is to spend hours of scripting just to get the data point in the right place while you have a full report/paper to write. LOL.
